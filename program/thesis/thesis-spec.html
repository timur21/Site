            <h3><a name="geninfo"></a>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>

            <h4><a name="intro"></a>INTRODUCTION</h4>

            <p class="main">This guide has been prepared by the MIT Libraries, as prescribed by the Committee on
                Graduate Programs, to assist students and faculty in the preparation of theses.  The Institute is
                committed to the preservation of each student's thesis because it is both a requirement for the MIT
                degree and a record of original research that contains information of lasting value.</p>

            <p class="main">The requirements in this guide apply to all theses and have been specified both to facilitate the care and
                dissemination of the thesis and to assure the preservation of the archival paper copy. Individual departments
                may dictate more stringent requirements.  Questions not answered in this guide should be referred to the
                appropriate department officer or to the IAAU Library.</p>

            <h4><a name="happen"></a>WHAT HAPPENS TO THE THESIS?</h4>

            <p class="main">The academic department is required to deliver the proper number of copies of the thesis to the IAAU Library
                within one month after the last day of the term in which the thesis was submitted (Faculty Regulation 2.72).
                One copy is kept as part of the permanent archival collection, and the other copy is reserved for future
                disposition.</p>

            <p class="main">An online catalog record, which includes the thesis abstract, is prepared for all theses deposited in the
                IAAU Library. This information appears in Yordam, our online catalog, which is accessible to researchers at
                other institutions through the Internet, as well as in the OCLC database WorldCat, an online international
                bibliographic system available to libraries and individuals worldwide.  PhD and ScD theses are also listed
                (with abstract) in ProQuest Dissertations & Theses database (PQDT) and Dissertation Abstracts International
                (DAI).</p>

            <p class="main">For each thesis received by the Library, a digital version is created and made publicly available in
                Yordam@IAAU (http://library.iaau.eud.kg). Copies of theses may be obtained through the IAAU Library. Students
                may choose to submit a born-digital PDF of the thesis using the procedures described on the Document Services
                web site (http://libraries.mit.edu/docs/about-theses/add-your-thesis.html). However, the electronic version is
                not considered to be the official copy.</p>

            <h4><a name="submit"></a>SUBMISSION DATE</h4>

            <p class="main">Degree candidates must submit the required copies of their theses to the appropriate office of the department
                or program in which they are registered on the dates specified in the Academic Calendar.  The Academic Calendar
                may be found in the MIT Bulletin and at http://web.mit.edu/registrar/www/calendar.html.  September, February,
                and June are the only months in which degrees are awarded.  Additional copies of the thesis may be required by
                the department.</p>

            <h4><a name="what-submit"></a>WHAT IS SUBMITTED</h4>

            <p class="main">All theses should be turned in to the appropriate departmental office; the office will deliver the theses to
                the IAAU Library within a month after the last day of term.  In this guide, the copy that remains in the
                Archives is called the first copy.  Additional copies required for the divisional libraries (see following
                section) are referred to as the second and (possibly) third copies.  The department may ask for copies in
                addition to those required for the Libraries. The student may, of course, keep personal copies.</p>

            <h4>Bachelor's Degree Theses</h4>

            <p class="main">Not all departments send bachelor's theses to the Archives.  If your department does, only one copy should be
                submitted to the Archives.  Please check the requirements of your department. Undergraduate students do not pay
                a library processing fee.</p>

            <h4>Graduate Degree Theses</h4>

            <p class="main">Number of copies: Normally, two copies are required for the Libraries – one for the Archives and a second for
                the appropriate divisional library.  A third copy is required only when a student is submitting the same thesis
                to departments or programs from two separate IAAU faculties (e.g., Management and Engineering). If the
                departments are in the same faculty (e.g., Engineering Systems and Applied Mathematics), only two copies are
                required.</p>

            <h4>Joint Theses</h4>

            <p class="main">Most IAAU theses are written by a single author.  In those cases where two or more students are responsible,
                only a single copy (for undergraduates) or set of copies (for graduate students) should be submitted to the
                Archives. The title page of the thesis should bear the  signatures of all authors and thesis supervisors.
                (Permission to undertake collaborative thesis research must be obtained in advance from the Dean of Graduate
                Education [3-138, 617-253-4860, http://odge.mit.edu/gpp/degrees/thesis/joint-theses).</p>

            <!--<h4>Submission of Doctoral Thesis Abstract to International Database: UMI/ProQuest Dissertations & Theses
             Database</h4>

            <p>Abstracts of all doctoral theses (PhD and ScD) will be submitted for inclusion in ProQuest Dissertations &
            Theses, an online database used by researchers around the world.  PQDT can be searched by author name, subject
             terms, and all words in the title and abstract.  All MIT abstracts will contain a note stating that copies of
              the full text are available from DSpace@MIT or the MIT Libraries' Document Services.</p>

            <p>Abstracts should be no longer than 350 words; longer abstracts will be edited by UMI/ProQuest.  Please
            complete the UMI/ProQuest form at http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/thesis-specs/images/umi-proquest-form.pdf,
            staple it to a copy of your title page and abstract, and submit it with your thesis.  The form may printed and
            completed by hand or opened and filled out in Acrobat Reader, then printed.</p>

            <p>When filling out the form, choose the appropriate subject categories from the list at
            http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/thesis-specs/images/umi-subjects.pdf.  Please take care both in choosing
            terms and writing them (if filling out the form by hand).  Subject-based access to your thesis will depend on
            the accuracy of the information you provide and the precision with which it is transcribed by UMI/ProQuest.
            It is especially important that your name appear on this form exactly as it does on the title page and abstract
             of your thesis.</p>-->

            <h4>CHANGES AFTER SUBMISSION OF THESIS</h4>

            <p class="main">All change made to a thesis, after the thesis has been submitted to the MIT Libraries by the student's
                department, must have prior approval from the Dean of Graduate or Undergraduate Education. When the purpose is
                to correct significant errors in content, the student should create an errata sheet using the form and
                instructions at http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/thesis-specs/images/errata-sheet.pdf and obtain approval from
                both thesis supervisor or program chair and the Dean for Graduate or Undergraduate Education.  If the purpose
                of change is to excise classified, proprietary, or confidential information, the student should fill out the
                application form at http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/thesis-specs/images/page-substitution.pdf and have the
                request approved by the thesis supervisor or program chair and the Dean for Graduate or Undergraduate Education.
                Students and supervisors should vet thesis content carefully before submission to avoid both scenarios whenever
                possible.</p>

            <!--<h4>FEES</h4>

            <p>Students receiving advanced degrees from MIT are required to pay a library processing fee: $115.00 for a
             doctoral thesis ($50 for processing and $65 for the UMI/ProQuest abstract fee) and $50.00 for all other
             advanced-degree theses.  Thesis charges will be added to student bills during the semester immediately
             preceding graduation. Although the charges may appear on student accounts early in the semester, they are not
             due until the thesis is submitted.  Late fees will not be applied up to that point. Undergraduate students do
             not pay a processing fee.</p>

            <h4>BINDING</h4>

            <p>All copies must be submitted to the student’s department unbound between cardboard covers; the thesis and
             covers should be clipped or tied together, NOT stapled or punched.  Recycled temporary covers and binder clips
             are available in a cabinet outside the Map Room in the Hayden Library basement and at the Institute Archives
             (14N-118). The front cover should be labeled with the following information: author's name, thesis title,
             course, month and year of graduation, and which copy it is (first, second, or third).</p>

            <p>The MIT Libraries pay for the binding of theses retained in their collection.  Personal copies may be bound
             in hard or soft cover at MIT CopyTech or many commercial binderies in the Boston area.<p>-->

            <h4><a name="copyright"></a>COPYRIGHT</h4>

            <p class="main">The Institute's policy concerning ownership of thesis copyright is covered in Rules and Regulations of the
                Faculty, 2.73. (http://web.mit.edu/faculty/governance/rules/2.70.html) and MIT Policies and Procedures 13.1.3
                (http://web.mit.edu/policies/13/13.1.html#sub3). The following are guidelines to assist the student in
                determining who holds ownership of the thesis copyright:</p>

                <li><p>the thesis research is performed in whole or in part by the student with financial support in the
                    form of wages, salary, stipend, or grant from funds administered by the Institute</p></li>
                and/or
                <li><p>the thesis research is performed in whole or in part utilizing equipment or facilities provided to the
                    Institute under conditions that impose copyright restrictions.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p class="main">In general, students may retain ownership of thesis copyrights when the only form of support is (a) teaching
                assistantships (the duties of which do not include research activities) and (b) NSF and NIH traineeships and
                fellowships (although the trainee or fellow may be required to grant certain publishing rights to NSF or NIH).
                Actual determination of a student's status is made by reference to the account from which the student receives
                support.  Questions regarding restrictions imposed on any of the Institute's facilities or equipment may be
                addressed to the administrative officer of the laboratory or department or to the appropriate contract
                administrator in the Office of Sponsored Programs (http://osp.mit.edu/). Specific questions on permission to
                copyright should be referred to the Technology Licensing Office (617-253-6966, tlo@mit.edu).</p>

            <p class="main">When copyright ownership is held by the student, the student must, as condition of a degree award, grant
                royalty-free permission to the Institute to reproduce and publicly distribute copies of the thesis, and must
                place the following legend on the thesis title page: "The author hereby grants to MIT permission to reproduce
                and to distribute publicly paper and electronic copies of this thesis document in whole or in part in any
                medium now known or hereafter created."  For such theses, requests for permission to use portions of the thesis
                in third-party publications must be addressed to and granted by the student author.</p>

            <p class="main">When copyright is held by the Institute, students and third parties should contact the MIT Technology
                Licensing Office (617-253-6966, tlo@mit.edu) to obtain permission to reuse thesis content in other publications.
                However, the student is authorized to post electronic versions of the student’s own thesis, in whole or in part,
                on the World Wide Web.  Any further publication of the thesis in whole or in part shall be made only with the
                authorization of the Technology Licensing Office, in consultation with the head of the department or course in
                which the student was registered when the thesis was accepted.</p>

            <p class="main">Regardless of whether copyright is held by the student or the Institute, the MIT Libraries publish the thesis
                electronically in DSpace@MIT (http://dspace.mit.edu) allowing open access viewing and limited downloading /
                printing.</p>

            <p class="main">Students may request a waiver of Institute copyright by written application to the Institute's Technology
                Licensing Office (http://web.mit.edu/tlo/www/community/suw.html). The waiver shall be granted only if the
                retained rights of the student as described in this guide are inadequate for the student’s needs and if a
                license from the Institute to the student would also be inadequate.  Any such waiver of the Institute’s
                copyright shall be subject to a royalty-free grant from the student to the Institute to publicly distribute
                copies of the thesis, in whole or in part.  The student must also place the legend above on the thesis title
                page.</p>

            <h4><a name="implement"></a>Implementation: How to Copyright a Thesis</h4>

            <p class="main">Each student should place the appropriate copyright notice on the thesis.  Copyright notice consists of four
                elements:</p>
            <ul class="main">
                <li>the symbol "c" with a circle around it C and/or the word "copyright,"</li>
                <li>the year of publication (the year in which the degree is to be awarded),</li>
                <li>the name of the copyright owner, and</li>
                <li>the words "All rights reserved."</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="main">These four elements should appear together on the title page (or verso of the title page).</p>
            <p class="main">Examples:</p>
            <ul class="main">
                <li>student is copyright owner: © 2008 Jane Doe. All rights reserved.</li>
                <li>Institute is copyright owner: © 2008 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. All rights reserved.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="main">See sample title pages.  A copyright notice should also appear on any non-paper material (e.g., DVD or CD)
                included with a thesis.</p>

            <h4><a name="plagiarism"></a>Use of Previously Published Material in a Thesis</h4>

            <p class="main">Each student is responsible for obtaining permission, if necessary, to include previously published material
                in the thesis. (See http://libraries.mit.edu/about/scholarly/reuse-figures.html).  This applies to most
                third-party materials (i.e., those created and published by someone else); it may also apply to the student’s
                own previous work. If, for example, a student has already published part of the thesis as a journal article and,
                as a condition of publication, has assigned title to the  journal's publisher, the student has no further rights
                in the article. Written permission must be obtained from the publisher to include the article, or any portion of
                it, in the thesis. Similarly, permission must be obtained to include papers written while the student was
                employed by a commercial company or non-profit organization if title belongs to the company or organization.
                A sample permission letter can be obtained from the Office of the General Counsel
                (http://web.mit.edu/ogc/faq/#q14).</p>

            <p class="main">If the student knows, prior to publication or employment, that such material will be included in a thesis,
                he or she may wish to retain title to the material or to reserve sufficient rights to use the material. Further
                information is available at Scholarly Publishing @ MIT Libraries
                (http://libraries.mit.edu/sites/scholarly/publishing/) or from Ellen Duranceau, Program Manager for Scholarly
                Publishing (617-253-8483, efinnie@mit.edu).</p>

            <h4><a name="policy"></a>POLICY FOR TEMPORARY RESTRICTIONS ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESES</h4>

            <p class="main">Thesis research should be undertaken in light of MIT's policy of open research and the free interchange of
                information.  Written notification of patent holds and other restrictions must reach the Institute Archives
                before the thesis in question is received, since under normal circumstances all theses are open and available
                for public inspection once they have been received by the Archives.  When there is good reason for delaying the
                distribution of a thesis, the procedures below should be followed.</p>

            <p class="main">For additional details on procedures for temporary restrictions, please see Graduate Policies and Procedures
                at http://odge.mit.edu/gpp/degrees/thesis/thesis-hold/.</p>

            <h4>Patent Claims</h4>

            <p class="main">When MIT holds the rights to any intellectual property contained in a thesis, students and their supervisors
                must work with the MIT Technology Licensing Office (http://web.mit.edu/tlo/www/) to determine if a patent
                application is to be filed. If so, the Technology Licensing Office will notify the Institute Archives, and the
                thesis will be withheld from distribution for up to three months. If an extension is required, application must
                be made to the Vice President for Research, who will inform the Archives if an extension is approved.</p>

            <p class="main">When a student holds the rights to any intellectual property contained in his or her thesis, application for
                permission to withhold a thesis must be made to the Dean for Graduate Education for graduate theses or the Dean
                for Undergraduate Education for undergraduate theses.  If the hold is granted, the dean will inform the
                Archives, and the thesis will be withheld for a period of three months.  If an extension is required,
                application must be made to the Vice President for Research.</p>

            <h4><a name="gov"></a>Government Restrictions</h4>

            <p class="main">A student should not embark without prior approval on a thesis that requires government restrictions. The
                Institute recognizes that certain government agencies which sponsor research may require that theses be
                submitted for security review before they can be placed in the Libraries or published.</p>

            <h4><a name="privacy"></a>Privacy and Security</h4>

            <p class="main">Occasionally, on completing a thesis, a student may believe that its distribution will jeopardize the privacy
                or safety of the author, other individuals, or organizations.  If the thesis cannot be rewritten to remove
                the problematic material, the author and supervisor should submit the thesis to the director of the program,
                who will prepare a recommendation for the Dean for Graduate Education for graduate theses or the Dean for
                Undergraduate Education for undergraduate theses, who will then consult with the Vice President for
                Research.  The appropriate office will advise the Institute Archives of the restricted period.  In all cases
                the restricted period should be kept to a minimum.</p>

            <h3><a name="format"></a>FORMATTING</h3>

            <h4>PAGINATION</h4>

            <p class="main">The title page is always considered to be page 1, and every page must be included in the count regardless of
                whether a number is physically printed on a page. The entire thesis (including title page, prefatory
                material, illustrations, and all text and appendices) must be paginated in one consecutive numbering
                sequence.</p>

            <p class="main">Theses should be prepared double-sided whenever possible.  In a double-sided thesis, both sides of every page
                (starting with the title page and including any pages that have been left blank) must be accounted for in
                the numbering sequence.  Therefore, in a double-sided thesis, odd-numbered pages are always on the right and
                even-numbered pages on the left.  Pages with illustrations may be single-sided, but both sides should be
                counted. Single-sided theses should be numbered only on the front of every sheet.</p>

            <p class="main">When using thesis templates on Athena, use caution and verify that the pagination requirements are being
                met.</p>

            <h4>PREFATORY MATERIAL</h4>

            <p class="main">Your work will be a more valuable research tool for other scholars if it can be located easily.  Search
                engines use the words in the title, and sometimes other descriptive words, to locate works. Therefore,
            <ol class="main">
                <li>be sure to select a title that is a meaningful description of the content of your manuscript;
                    and</li>
                <li>when possible, use word substitutes for formulas, symbols, superscripts, Greek letters, etc., which
                    do not appear on most computer keyboards and would make your title more difficult to search.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="main">Examples:</p>
            <ul class="main">
                <li>"The Effects of Ion Implantation and Annealing on the Properties of Titanium Silicide [not TiSi2] Films
                    on Silicon Substrates"</li>
                <li>"Radiative Decays of the J/Psi [not J/ψ] to Two Pseudoscalar Final States"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Thesis Title Page</h4>

            <p class="main">The title page of the first copy must bear the original signatures of the author, supervisor, and chairman;
                a photocopy of the signed title page is acceptable for the second copy.  The title page should contain the
                title, name of the author, previous degrees, the degree(s) to be awarded at MIT, the date the degree(s) will
                be conferred (June, September, or February only), copyright notice, and appropriate names and signatures.</p>

            <p class="main">For candidates receiving two degrees, both degrees to be awarded should appear on the title page. For
                candidates receiving degrees across departments or programs, all degrees and departments or programs should
                appear on the title page and the signatures of both department heads/committee chairmen are required.
                Whenever there are co-supervisors, both signatures are required. See the proper title page layout [PDF].</p>

            <p class="main">Sample Title Pages:</p>
            <ul class="main">
                <li>Bachelor's Degree, Student Owns Copyright [PDF]</li>
                <li>PhD Degree, MIT Owns Copyright [PDF]</li>
                <li>Simultaneous Master's Degrees, Two Departments [PDF]</li>
                <li>All Degrees, Multiple Authors [gif image]</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Thesis Abstract Page</h4>

            <p class="main">Each thesis offered for a graduate degree must include an abstract, preferably one single-spaced page, but
                never more than two pages (generally less than 350 words).  The abstract should be thought of as a brief
                descriptive summary rather than a lengthy introduction to the thesis.  Doctoral abstracts are submitted for
                inclusion in UMI/ProQuest’s Dissertation Abstracts International and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses
                database (PQDT). Doctoral candidates should keep their abstracts under 350 words.  Longer abstracts will be
                edited and shortened by UMI/ProQuest.  Databases such as PQDT provide full-text searching of abstracts, so
                the presence of significant key words in a short abstract will facilitate access. The abstract should
                immediately follow the title page.</p>

            <p>Sample Abstract [PDF]</p>

            <h4>Biographical Note and Acknowledgment</h4>

            <p class="main">Although not a requirement, each thesis may contain a short biography of the candidate, including
                institutions attended and dates of attendance, degrees and honors, titles of publications, teaching and
                professional experience, and other matters that may be pertinent.  An acknowledgment page may also be
                included.  These sections may be single-spaced.</p>

            <p class="main">Please note that your thesis will be publicly available online at DSpace@MIT, which is regularly crawled and
                indexed by Google and other search-engine providers.</p>

            <h4>STYLE</h4>

            <p class="main">The style of quotations, footnotes, and bibliographic references may be prescribed by your department.  If
                your department does not prescribe a style or specify a style manual, choose one and be consistent.
                Further information is available on the web site of the MIT Writing Center
                (http://writing.mit.edu/wcc/citation).</p>

            <h4>NOTES AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES</h4>

            <p class="main">Whenever possible, notes should be placed at the bottom of the appropriate page or in the body of the text.
                Notes should conform to the style appropriate to the discipline.  If notes appear at the bottom of the page,
                they should be single-spaced and included within the specified margins (see section below).</p>

            <p class="main">It may be appropriate to place bibliographic references either at the end of the chapter in which they occur
                or at the end of the thesis.</p>

            <h4>APPENDICES</h4>

            <p class="main">The same paper size and quality, pagination, margins, notes, and illustration requirements apply to
                appendices. They support the research in your thesis and should be as readable and reproducible as the rest
                of your work. Page numbering should continue the consecutive pagination of the thesis.</p>

            <h4>TYPEFACE AND SIZE</h4>

            <p class="main">For the main body of the text, including appendices and front matter, font size should be at least 11-point
                and should not be script or italic.  Italics may, however, be used for short quotations or to highlight
                variables in an equation, for example.  Notes and the text in tables, etc., should not be smaller than
                10-point.</p>

            <h4>MARGINS AND SPACING</h4>

            <p class="main">Top, bottom, and both side margins must be at least an inch wide (1") to allow for binding and trimming. All
                information (text headings, notes, and illustrations), excluding page numbers, must be within the text area.
                Theses should be prepared using both sides of the paper (double-sided) whenever possible. Oversize sheets
                must be folded to come within the text area so the folds will not be trimmed off or bound in during the
                binding procedure.</p>

            <p class="main">The text of the thesis may be single- double- or one-and-a-half-spaced.  The abstract, biography, notes,
                bibliography, and acknowledgment should be single-spaced.</p>

            <p class="main">If you are writing your thesis on Athena, follow the formatting and typeface instructions under the LATEX or
                FRAME olc stock answer topics by typing the command "olc_answers" on any Athena workstation.</p>

            <h3><a name="product"></a>PRODUCTION</h3>

            <h4>USING ATHENA</h4>

            <p class="main">If you are preparing your thesis on Athena, follow the instructions under the LATEX or FRAME olc stock answer
                topics by typing the command "olc_answers."  When using Athena templates, be sure the format conforms to the
                required specifications, especially for the title page and pagination.  Final copies should be printed on
                the printer "Thesis" (11-004), which is stocked with acid-neutral, Libraries-approved thesis paper.</p>

            <h4>PAPER</h4>

            <p class="main">First copy: For the first copy the paper must be chosen for its permanence and durability.  This is the copy
                that should bear the original signatures. The paper must be (a) acid‑neutral or acid-free, (b) watermarked,
                (c) at least 20-lb. weight, and (d) contain at least 25% cotton.  It may contain some post-consumer waste
                (pcw) recycled material.  The following 20‑lb. watermarked acid‑neutral papers are examples of those that
                are acceptable</p>
            <ul class="main">
                <li>Mohawk Via Bright White (available at CopyTech, 11-004)</li>
                <li>Xerox Image Elite</li>
                <li>Crane's Thesis Paper</li>
                <li>Hammermill Bond</li>
                <li>Strathmore Bond</li>
            </ul>


            <p class="main">Second copy: The paper for the second copy should be (a) acid-neutral or acid-free, (b) at least 20-lb.
                weight, and (c) contain 25% cotton.  It need not be watermarked.</p>

            <p class="main">The following are not acceptable for either copy: MIT bond, erasable paper, or regular paper from photocopy
                machines. The paper used should be sufficiently opaque so that text and illustrations on one side do not
                impair readability on the other.  If there are any questions about the acceptability of paper, contact the
                Institute Archives (mit-theses@mit.edu, 617-253-5136).</p>

            <p class="main">If you are preparing your thesis on Athena, print the final copies on the printer "Thesis," which is stocked
                with Mohawk Via Bright White.</p>

            <p class="main">The standard size for theses is 8½ by 11 inches (see section on oversized pages).</p>

            <h4>DOUBLE-SIDED OR SINGLE-SIDED PRINTING</h4>

            <p class="main">Double-sided printing is strongly recommended. However, the paper should be sufficiently opaque so that text
                and illustrations on one side do not impair readability on the other side. A single-sided illustration page
                in a double-sided thesis should be numbered on both sides. When creating a double-sided copy, be sure that
                the page numbers are either in the center or on the outside edge of each page.</p>

            <h4>OVERSIZED PAGES</h4>

            <p class="main">Charts, graphs, tables, etc., should be reduced whenever possible to an 8½-by-11-inch format.  If material
                is not reducible, oversize sheets must be folded to come within the text area so the folds will not be
                trimmed off or bound in during the binding procedure.  Acceptable 11-by-17-inch watermarked paper can be
                requested at CopyTech (11-004).</p>

            <h4>GRAPHICS</h4>

            <h5>Use of Color</h5>

            <p class="main">Students may print their theses in full color.  Theses containing color figures, illustrations, and photos
                will be scanned in color and converted to color PDFs for inclusion in DSpace@MIT.  Please be aware that
                heavily saturated color graphics may “bleed through” and compromise legibility for double-sided pages.
                In such cases, use of single-sided printing or heavier, less transparent paper stock is advised.</p>

            <h5>Photographs</h5>

            <p class="main">Pages containing photographs should be numbered as regular pages.  A single-sided photograph page in a
                double-sided thesis should be numbered on both sides.</p>
            <p>All graphics must respect  the 1”  margins.</p>

            <h4>NON-PAPER FORMATS AND MEDIA</h4>

            <p class="main">Digital and magnetic materials such as cassette tapes, CDs, and DVDs may accompany the written text of the
                thesis; one should accompany each copy of the thesis submitted. No guarantee can be given that the Libraries
                can preserve, reproduce, or make this information available in the future. Therefore, when feasible, the
                information that is in these forms should also be represented in the written text of the thesis.</p>

            <h5>Labels</h5>

            <p class="main">A label containing the author's name, the date of the thesis, and the copyright notice must be applied to all
                material in non-paper format.  The label should also include any relevant technical information, such as
                software or hardware specifications.</p>
